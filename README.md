# Combot

Combot is a tool which makes it easier for players to pick up new combos for any character. It was built with Tekken in mind but can apply to any game at all.

# Installation
```
npm install
npm start
```

# Usage
**Combo Creators**
To create a combo, hit record and begin entering the sequence of strings using your controller or keyboard. If nothing is happening, open the key bindings dialog to bind your inputs.
If you're satisfied with the combo you can save it. Otherwise, you can reset and try again.

# Questions
* How do I synchronise the timing of the combos without the game running?
	* Run your game in windowed mode and keep the browser tab open. When you begin to input your combo, the browser can still access all key presses.
